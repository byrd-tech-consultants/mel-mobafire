[td bgcolor="#654321" padding="20px"][color=#FFFF99]At this point in the game, most towers have fallen and the game will be over in 1-2 teamfights. Sidelaning is no more. Our biggest concern, especially in soloqueue is that your ADC will randomly run into midlane and immediately get killed. This happens [b]ALL THE TIME[/b]. Do not leave your team alone, and only defend/ catch sidewaves when necessary. We should have 4-5 items at this point, and getting more gold/items from farming is great, but [b]protecting our team from dieing is the highest priority[/b]. Teamfighting in the late-game is the same as mid-game, but with more extremes. Tanky champions will be nearly unkillable while mages, assassins, and ADCs do [b]CRAZY damage[/b] to each other. One mistake can lose the game, so we need to minimize our own, while capitalizing on the enemies.[/color][/td]
