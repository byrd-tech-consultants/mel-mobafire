[color=#FFFF99]At this point in the game, most towers have fallen and the game will be over in 1-2 teamfights. Sidelaning is no more. Our biggest concern, especially in soloqueue is that your ADC will randomly run into midlane and immediately get killed. This happens ALL THE TIME. Do not leave your team alone, and only defend/ catch sidewaves when necessary. We should have 4-5 items at this point, and getting more gold/items from farming is great, but protecting our team from dieing is the highest priority. Teamfighting in the late-game is the same as mid-game, but with more extremes. Tanky champions will be nearly unkillable while mages, assassins, and ADCs do CRAZY damage to each other. One mistake can lose the game, so we need to minimize our own, while capitalizing on the enemies.[/color]
