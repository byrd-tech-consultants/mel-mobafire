[size=16][color=#FFD700][b]Arcane Comet[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Unlike most champions, [[Mel]] has one rune that she should be running in every game, that rune is comet. The oppressive gameplay of [[Mel]], particularly in the early game, comes from her ability to bully opponents with her long range. While her [[Radiant Volley]] doesn't ALWAYS do a large amount of damage, as the enemy can easily dodge several of the missiles, we can utilize this ability to nearly guarantee that we will proc our Comet and Scorch, giving us an extra 50 damage earlygame on every trade.

Keep in mind that in the future, this may change, but the damage provided by Comet and our ability to proc it HEAVILY outshines First Strike & Summon Aery, the other runes that we would consider running in its place.[/color]

[size=14][color=#FFD700][b]Manaflow Band[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Taking Manaflow Band is essential on [[Mel]]. Her [[Radiant Volley]] costs a whopping 110 mana at max rank, making her easily one of the most mana hungry mages, especially late game. To offset this, we run manaflow band which gives us some much needed sustain after reaching the 250 mana. Our other options, Axiom Arcanist and Nimbus Cloak are well… they are really bad. Almost no champions in the game, outside of the odd jungler running Nimbus Cloak, utilize these runes. Stay away from them and stick with Manaflow Band.[/color]

[size=14][color=#FFD700][b]Transcendence[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Transcendence is a very simple rune, it offers us 10 ability haste (the ability cooldown refund is negligible). The question becomes, is this 10 ability haste more valuable than Celerity (useless as we don't build movespeed), and Absolute Focus? 

In my opinion, transcendence is the best rune here because the ability power of absolute focus is never very strong. At the latest point in the game, it gives us 30 ability power, a number outshined by the 48 ability power given by gathering storm at 30 minutes, and even still, only applies when we are above 70% HP. As such, we cannot rationalize giving up the 10 ability haste, an incredibly useful stat, for a situational 30 ability power that we often won't be able to utilize.[/color]

[size=14][color=#FFD700][b]Scorch[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Scorch on [[Mel]] can be so strong it often feels like another Keystone. While it provides us nothing late game, as 40 damage at max-level is actually less-damage than auto from a caster minion, 20 DAMAGE every 10 SECONDS at the start of the game is insane. Whenever playing with scorch, try to hold one of your abilities to proc this rune on cooldown. By the time you take your first reset, you will often find that scorch has already done 200 damage. Now, there are times that Scorch won't be the best rune, but this isn't because scorch is weak. In some situations, the enemy will just be too passive/tanky for us to kill in lane, and we can instead take Gathering Storm for stronger scaling (see below).[/color]

[size=14][color=#FFD700][b]Gathering Storm[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Strong scaling rune that provides ability power as the game progresses. I'll keep it brief, if we can't kill the enemy because they are playing a super passive game (Garen, Nasus, etc.), then we can look to take Gather Storm and scale into the late game. This rune is super niche, and in MAYBE 5% of games should you look to take it currently.[/color]

[size=14][color=#FFD700][b]Presence of Mind[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Upon proccing Presence of Mind, we gain back a small amount of mana. Takedowns will also restore 15% of our maximum mana pool. This rune is optimal for [[Mel]] as she can proc it A LOT throughout the laning phase given her longer range and poking abilities. While it's not the strongest per say, we don't have many great secondary options, and Presence of Mind will enable us to get a couple of extra ability casts in the early game. Not the best, not the worst, but certainly worth taking.[/color]

[size=14][color=#FFD700][b]Legend: Haste[/b][/color][/size]

[color=#FFFF99]Legend: Haste provides us with 15 basic ability haste later into the game. As we run a burn build, having our abilities off cooldown to proc [[Liandry's Torment]] and [[Blackfire Torch]] is super important. 15 ability haste feels like an absolute game changer and with the current ability haste values on mage items, it feels nearly impossible to have a good item build with a meaningful amount of haste in the late-game. For this reason, I'm always running this rune, though Coup De Grace is another good option, particularly if you choose to play a burstier build with [[Luden's Companion]] and [[Shadowflame]] (not me personally).[/color]

[color=#FFFF99]These are the standard shards that I use on [[Mel]]. I don't personally run [[Attack Speed]], but feel free to swap the [[Health Scaling]] for [[Tenacity]] against a lot of CC, or one of the [[Ability Power]] shards for [[Attack Speed]].[/color]
